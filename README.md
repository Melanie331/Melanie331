Dedicated to enhancing global health systems through population health research and health data science. I combine analytical precision with systems-level thinking to uncover patterns and enhance public health outcomes.

- I have 4 years of experience conducting epi research, data analytics and implementing primary health care projects in Africa.
- Currently serving as a Section Editor, Journal of Public Health in Africa (JPHIA), Recent Trends in Traditional Medicine, Health Research, and Development, invited by Dr. Nebiyu Dereje Abebe, the Editor-in-Chief.

- Key achievements:
  
  - Collaborated in continental research identifying environmental determinants associated with climate-induced migration on cholera outbreaks in Eastern and Southern Africa through the Climate For Health Research Lab Fellowship at Oath For Sustainability Network. The study was accepted as a poster presentation at the Climate and Health Africa Conference in Harare, Zimbabwe, in 2024, and is currently submitted for publication in relevant scientific journals.
