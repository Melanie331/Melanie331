# Hi, I'm Melanie 👋🏾

Dedicated to enhancing global health systems through infectious disease research, bioinformatics, and health data science. I combine analytical precision with systems-level thinking to uncover patterns, inform policy, and enhance population health outcomes.

  - I have 4 years of experience in conducting epi research, data analytics and executing primary health care programs in Africa.
  - Currently serving as a Section Editor invited by the Journal of Public Health in Africa (JPHIA), Africa CDC.
  - Previously a Committee Chair in the Sub-Saharan African International Model United Nations (SAIMUN), 2020.

My current focus lies in exploring mixed-methods research for complex public health challenges and investigating health equity through data-driven insights, while strengthening my skills in inferential statistics, R, Python, and data visualisation. I aim to expand my knowledge and expertise in bioinformatics and pathogen genomics to support surveillance systems.
